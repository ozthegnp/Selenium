Hello there,

My name is Oscar. I have worked as a QA Engineer for the past 1.5 years. 
Besides other test automation tools I would like to continue to expand my knowledge with Selenium and learn coding with Java.

I am taking a 55 hours udemy course of ["Selenium Webdriver with Java - Basics to Advanced + Frameworks"](https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-real-time-examplesinterview-questions/).

Please follow my Journey of learning Java and Selenium.
